GSAP ideas for Fretology:

- eventlistners in JavaScript - learn this seperately ...
- hower effects (lay all notes in dimm, greyedout background, highlight upon hower while the selected options remains highlighted in a different color
- build the svg graphic accordingly ...
- play with colors in go-tweens (research a bit of color theory)
- check the methods play, reverse, pause, etc ...
- explore timeline more ...
- you can set the configurations in the timeline object such as paused state etc ...
- check gsap.default({})
- functions and arrow functions
- using loops in animations ...
- DOM selectors are important (byId, byClass, querySelector, querySelectorAll ...)
- querySelectorAll returns a nodelist - check mdn docs
- audio playing animation for the notes ... like the examples on gsap-showcase
- transformOrigin define from which point the graphics scale or start - check this later
- check opacity
- check the from Tween (what does this mean in various contexts ...)
- var tl = gsap.timeline({repeat:1, yoyo:true}) - applies to everything inside the timeline ...
- timeline defaults:
  var tl = gsap.timeline({defaults:{opacity:0, ease:"back", etc}})
